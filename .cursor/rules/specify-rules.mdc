## Speckit: Orchestrator and subagents (non-negotiable)

**Speckit commands (specify, plan, tasks, implement, etc.) and each SDD phase task must run in subagents.** This is not optional.

- **Orchestrator agent (main):** The agent where commands are invoked. Its role is to:
  - Invoke commands (speckit.specify, speckit.plan, speckit.tasks, speckit.implement, etc.) and pass them the project context they need.
  - Receive the result from each subagent when it finishes.
  - Keep process context by having each subagent report back what it did when it completes.

- **Subagents:** Each SDD phase has its own subagent with focused context:
  - The orchestrator gives them project context so they can do their task in a focused way.
  - They run the task (specify, plan, break down tasks, implement, etc.) in their own context.
  - **When done, they report back to the orchestrator** and explain what they did, so the orchestrator has up-to-date process context without filling its main context.

**Non-negotiable rule:** Speckit commands and SDD tasks must not run in the orchestrator agent; they must always be delegated to subagents. This avoids saturating the orchestrator’s context and gives each phase the right context.
